## Project Mission

Develop a new, innovative and dynamic website to serve as the online forward facing representative of the Saran Thai brand, people, culture, service offerings and most importantly its commercial strategic objectives. 

## Team members and Roles

## Purpose 

The teams client for the final MERN Project is Rosie. Rosie is the owner and head of operations of the Saran Thai restaurant in Wyoming Sydney. The website being developed will provide Rosie a platform to promote her business assisting her in increasing the marketability and raise public awareness of her business.  The website will also allow Rosie to customise the restaurants menu how she sees fit. The website will also provide a platform for the general public to view the menu online, and learn more about the restaurants operating hours and location.

## Functionality and Features

The website for customers will allow them to view the menu and filter the menu by different categories or filters, and search for different items on the menu. They will also have access to  other business information, and make reservations for themselves in advance. For the owner of the restaurant they will have access to an administrator dashboard  that will allow them to modify the menu how they see fit through basic CRUD operations, customise the theme of the website itself and confirm any reservations that have been made by customers.

Future features may include Facebook integration to view & like their Facebook page from the website, Google API integration to read and write reviews of the website, and OpenTable API integration to simplify the reservation system.

## Target Audience

After conducting research on the demographics of Wyoming and the close surrounding areas the target market of the website was identified to be families and middle aged/senior individuals. 

The second main target audience is the owner of the restaurant. The owner is in her mid 50's and is relatively unskilled with technology.  In order to fulfil the needs of the identified target audience the website will have a heavy focus on simplicity and ease of use.

## User stories

- Rosie is the owner of Saran Thai, a Thai cuisine restaurant located in Wyoming. Rosie believes she beats the local competition because of the large variety of quality authentic dishes they produce. 
Rosie, is constantly changing and updating the menu. Now, Rosie wants to expand her business, by building up Saran Thaiâ€™s online presence with a website.
Rosie previously hired a Web Designer for this purpose, however she was frustrated, because her ever-changing menu had to be updated by the Web Designer in code, which cost her time and money.
Rosie is looking for a simple to use website, with an online menu that she can update herself. As well as provide her customers with information on her restaurant including the location and operating hours.

- Jodie is your typical Wyoming resident in her mid 40s who lives with her family that includes her husband & son. Jodie enjoys visiting Saran Thai with her family and is looking to use a simple version of the restaurant's website.
Jodie would like the website to clearly show the restaurant's full menu and operating hours with the ability to search for her favourite dishes for herself and her family.
Her husband is vegetarian so Jodie would like to be able to search for all the vegetarian dishes that are available in the restaurant. In addition to this, Jodie would also like to be able to determine the cost of her meal using the prices that are available and accurate on the site.

- As the owner of Saran Thai I would like an authorised admin user, so that only I can edit the menus.

- As the owner of Saran Thai I would like potential customers viewing my website to view our contact information and phone number, so that they can order food with us.

- As a customer of Saran Thai viewing the online website, I want to find the phone number of Saran Thai, so that I can order takeaway.
